KubeVirt is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes. The aim is to provide a common ground for virtualization solutions on top of Kubernetes.

This scenario demonstrates how KubeVirt can be used to start a virtual machine.

KubeVirt allows a user to run virtual machines on Kubernetes just like pods. Because KubeVirt integrates with the Kubernetes API and resource model, the same set of tools can be used to manage and monitor virtual machines.
